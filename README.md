# CS-260-Final

Overview: Throughout the course, you will complete programming assignments that requiring the appropriate application of data structures and algorithms as
well as implementing industry best practices. The programing assignments in Modules Three - Six are all candidates for the artifact submissions for your Final
Project and you should incorporate feedback from your instructor in your final project submission.
Assignment specifics:
Title/Topic Task Specifics
Module Three Lists, Linear Searches, and Pointers Create a search for bid function that searches by Bid ID using linked list with chaining
Module Four Queues, Stacks, and Sorting Create sorting functions for Bid Title using a selection sort and quicksort
Module Five Hash Tables and Chaining Create a search for Auction ID using hash tables
Module Six Trees and Binary Searches Create a search for Auction ID using binary tree search
Prompt: Each of your programming assignments includes two parts:
 A code reflection and the associated pseudocode or flowchart
 Annotated .cpp code file(s)
The two assignment parts are submitted together: The written submission is typed in the Text Submission box, and the code is included as a separate file
attachment. (See the image below.)
The following critical elements should be addressed in your project submission:
I. Code Reflection: A brief explanation of the code and its purpose, and a brief discussion of your experience in developing it, including any issues that you
encountered while completing the exercise and what approaches you took to solve them.
II. Pseudocode or Flowchart: A pseudocode or flowchart description of the code that is clear and understandable and captures accurate logic to translate
to the programming language.
III. Specifications and Correctness: Source code must meet its specifications and behave as desired. Correct code produces the correct output as defined by
the data and problem; however, you should also produce fully functioning code (with no errors) that aligns with as many of the specifications as
possible. You should write your code in such a way that the submitted file actually executes, even if it does not produce the correct output. You will be
given credit for partially correct output that can actually be viewed and seen to be partially correct.
IV. Annotation / Documentation: All code should also be well-commented. This is a practiced art that requires striking a balance between commenting
everything, which adds a great deal of unneeded noise to the code, and commenting nothing. Well-annotated code requires you to:
A. Explain the purpose of lines or sections of your code, detailing the approach and method you took to achieve a specific task in the code
B. Document any section of code that is producing errors or incorrect results
V. Modular and Reusable: Programmers should develop code that is modular and reusable. If it contains functionality and responsibility in distinct
methods, code is more flexible and maintainable. Your code should adhere to the single responsibility principle—classes and/or methods should do only
one job. If you can replace a method with another that uses a different technique or implementation without impacting (having to refactor or rewrite)
other parts of your code, then you have succeeded in creating modular methods.
VI. Readability: Code needs to be readable to a knowledgeable programmer. In this course, readable code requires:
A. Consistent, appropriate whitespace (blank lines, spaces) and indentation to separate distinct parts of the code and operations
B. Explicit, consistent variable names, which should clearly indicate the data they hold and be formatted consistently: for example, numOrders
(camelCase) and item_cost (underscored)
C. Organized structure and clear design that separates components with different responsibilities and/or grouping-related code into blocks
